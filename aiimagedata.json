She is wearing a loose navy blue sweatshirt, light beige chino pants, and classic black-and-white Converse sneakers. Her left arm rests on the desk while her right hand drops casually to the side. Behind her is a plain off-white classroom wall with visible wear and a slightly dirty texture. On the wall are several pinned papers, photos, and colorful sticky notes arranged in a grid. Among the papers, one clearly shows the printed word NewAiPrompt.com. positioned above her head. Sunlight enters sharply from the right side of the frame, creating a triangular beam of light on the wall and casting a strong shadow of her head and shoulders. The contrast between light and shadow is dramatic, cinematic, and natural, with a warm late-afternoon tone. The overall style feels candid and realistic, similar to a film photograph: slightly grainy, soft vintage texture, natural imperfections, not overly polished or digital."

Intense yellow flowers in Butter Vivid Yellow (#F6D860) cross the foreground, partially covering the face, with vibrant, luminous saturation that creates poetic layers. Cinematic side lighting with a strong golden-orange rim light outlines the silhouette. The light cuts through as if coming from Venetian blinds, casting stripes of shadow and glow across the face and flowers, producing an intimate and poetic effect. An analog atmosphere with subtle photographic noise and fine film-like grain evokes the feel of analog photography. A contrasting dark background enhances the composition, styled as a contemporary fashion magazine editorial. Rendered in extreme 8K quality, with photographic sharpness, realistic depth, and a poetic atmosphere."
